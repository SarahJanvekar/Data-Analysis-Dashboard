# Product Performance-Online Retail Store(Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)

## Project Objective:
To visualize and analyze product sales performance and identify key revenue-driving products and countries using Power BI, enabling data-driven business decisions.

## Insights:
This Power BI dashboard visualizes product sales performance using two key insights:
1) Top & Bottom 10 Products by Sales Revenue: Displays best and worst performing products by stock code.
2) Sales Revenue and Pareto by Country: Combines bar and line charts to show revenue distribution across countries and highlights the Pareto principle (80/20 rule).

## Overview of My Process:
1. Data Import & Cleaning: Loaded raw sales data into Power BI and cleaned it by removing duplicates, handling null values, and correcting data types.
2. Data Modeling: Created relationships between relevant tables (e.g., products, sales, countries) for accurate analysis.
3. Calculated Fields: Added measures such as Total Sales Revenue and created rankings for top/bottom products.
4. Visualization: Designed interactive visuals including bar charts, color-coded tables, and a Pareto chart to represent insights clearly.
5. Insight Extraction: Highlighted high-performing products, low performers, and top contributing countries to support decision-making.

## Usage:
Useful for identifying high-performing products and key markets for revenue contribution.
